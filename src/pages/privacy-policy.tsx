            How do we use your personal information? Information we collect is
            used to determine what is most effective about our platform, to help
            us identify ways to improve functionality, to personalize the visit
            for you with localStorage elements, and to determine how we can
            tailor our platform to make it more effective. We may also use data
            for other purposes, which we would describe to you at the point we
            collect the information (for example, if you are invited to register
            for an event). When you supply iTj library app by ITJ Inc. with your
            personal information, we may use the information to learn more about
            you so that we can develop better products and services or use the
            information, sharing it with our business partners, to inform you
            about new products, services and offers that may be of interest to
            you. Information uploaded to iTj library as a resume is used by your
            consent to participate in a hiring process for a certain open
            position posted in iTj library platform.

            What about sensitive data? We do not typically collect sensitive
            personal data through this platform. If we do seek to collect such
            data, we will inform you as to our intended use of such sensitive
            data and ask you to consent to our storing and the proposed uses of
            such data. We may also collect some sensitive personal data
            incidentally. For instance, we may collect data incidentally when a
            user uploads his/her resume, because the resume may contain this
            information. By providing us with unsolicited sensitive personal
            data, you consent to our using the data subject to applicable law as

            information used will be retained as per legal or contractual
            requirements in a secure system unless you requested us to dispose

            no longer have a need or a legal basis to process it. We&#39;ll
            always delete your data when we receive a request from you to do so.

            important to iTj library app by ITJ Inc. and we take appropriate
            steps to maintain the security of your personal information. The
            open nature of the Internet is such that data may flow over networks
            without security measures and may be accessed and used by people
            other than those for whom the data is intended. While this is out of
            our control, we aim to apply appropriate levels of security at all
            times. We use industry-standard technologies and maintain current
            security standards to ensure that your personal information is
            protected against unauthorized access, disclosure, inappropriate
            alteration, or misuse. We manage our server environment
            appropriately and our firewall infrastructure is strictly adhered
            to. We routinely employ current technologies to ensure that the
            confidentiality and privacy of your information are not compromised.
