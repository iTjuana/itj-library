              <li>Log in or create an account.</li>
              <li>
                Once you are logged in, browse the library catalog to find the
                book you want to borrow.
              </li>
              <li>
                Click on the book title to view its details. Look for the
                availability status, which will indicate if the book is
                currently available for borrowing.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the book is available, click on the option to borrow or add
                it to your borrowing list.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once you have selected the book, you will receive a due date for
                returning the book. Take note of this date, as it will determine
                when you need to return the book to the library. The due date is
                usually displayed in your account or can be sent to you via
                email.
              </li>
              <li>
                With the book successfully borrowed, you can start reading and
                enjoying it during the borrowing period.
